MongoDB transactions provide the ability to execute a sequence of operations as a single, atomic unit, ensuring data consistency across multiple documents, collections, and even databases or shards. This means that either all operations within the transaction succeed and are committed, or if any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database reverts to its state before the transaction began.

Key aspects of MongoDB transactions:

1. Atomicity: Transactions ensure that a group of operations is treated as a single, indivisible unit. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity in scenarios involving interdependent data changes, such as transferring funds between accounts or updating inventory levels alongside order creation.
2. Multi-document transactions: While MongoDB operations on a single document are inherently atomic, transactions extend this atomicity to operations involving multiple documents, providing ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees for these complex scenarios.
3. Sessions: Transactions in MongoDB are executed within logical sessions. A session groups related operations and enables causal consistency or ACID transactions.
4. Error handling and rollback: If an error occurs during a transaction, MongoDB automatically aborts the transaction and rolls back any changes made within it, preventing partial updates and ensuring data consistency.
5. Driver support: MongoDB drivers for various programming languages provide methods and APIs to facilitate the use of transactions, often including withTransaction helpers or explicit session management for transaction control.

When to use MongoDB transactions:

- Multi-document updates: When changes to one document necessitate corresponding changes in other documents to maintain data integrity (e.g., updating an order status and simultaneously adjusting inventory).
- Financial transactions: Ensuring the atomicity of money transfers, payment processing, and other financial operations.
- E-commerce and inventory management: Maintaining consistent inventory levels, processing orders, and managing payments securely.
